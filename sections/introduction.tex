A civic technology is one that aids civic society, where civic society, in this conception, is considered to be the \emph{commons} mediating between commerce and government.
There are a broad range of civic technology (or \say{civic tech} for short) projects, both commercial and charitable, from social networks such as Facebook \cite{facebook} to election monitoring applications such as Ushahidi \cite{ushahidi}. 
From the perspective of the UK, arguably one of the most well known (and, indeed, one of the most established) civic tech projects is They Work for You, which provides automated, accessible data about government. 
An overview of They Work for You will be presented, along with a discussion of its aims and values. 
The challenges faced by the site will also be addressed, before it is compared with another project, Wikipedia \cite{wikipedia}, with regard to taxonomoies of civc tech.
Many civic tech projects, moreover, including They Work for You, encompass elements from the open data movement,
and an overview of the movement will be presented directly below.
