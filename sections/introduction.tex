A civic technology is one that aids civic society, where civic society is considered to be the commons mediating between commerce and government.
There are a broad range of civic technology (or civic tech) projects, both commercial and charitable, from XXX to YYY. 
From the perspective of the UK, arguably one of the most well known (and, indeed, one of the most established) civic tech projects is They Work for You, which provides automated, accessible data about government. 
An overview of They Work for You will be presented, along with a discussion of its aims and values. 
The challenges faces by the site will also be addressed, before it is compared with another civic tech project, Wikipedia, with regard to taxonomoies of civc tech.
Many civic tech developments, however, including They Work for You, encompass elements from the civic hacking or open data movements.
Consequently, an overview of those movements will be provided directly below.
