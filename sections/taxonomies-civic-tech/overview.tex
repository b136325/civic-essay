In 2014 Micah Sifry \cite{micah-sifry-taxonomy} presented a visual depiction of a \emph{cartesian} taxonomy of civic tech, as shown within Figure \ref{fig:taxonomy-sifry}.
The vertical axis of the taxonomy represented a scale of participatory engagement from thin to click,
with \say{thin} representing a simple act, such as clicking a \emph{like} button within Facebook,
and \say{thick} representing more involved activities, such as, for example, developing Wikipedia entries.
The horizontal axis of the taxonomy depcits a scale of the aggregated outcomes of such engagement, 
from purely symbolic to those that promote lasting impactful change.
