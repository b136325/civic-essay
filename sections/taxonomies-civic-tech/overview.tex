In XXX Micah Sifry presented a visual depiction of a cartesian taxonomy of civic tech, as shown within Figure {fig:taxonomy-sifry}.
The vertical axis of the taxonomy represented a scale of participatory engagement from thin to click,
with 'thin' representing simply clicking a like button,
and 'thick' representing activities more involved.
The horizontal axis of the taxonomy depcits a scale of the aggregated outcome of such engagement, 
from purely symbolic to those that promote lasting impactful change.
