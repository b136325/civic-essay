It is suggested that there are two key tendencies within the broader open data movement.
The first tendency aims to ensure the availability of open and common data licences and standards, as exemplified by the work of Creative Commons \cite{creative-commons} and the World Wide Web Consortium \cite{w3c} (W3C), from a wide range of related organisations.
The second tendency, and with particular regard to politics, attempts to empower civic society with greater levels of knowledge, than would have been the case otherwise, in order to hold governments to account.
A well known example of this tendency is Wikileaks \cite{wikileaks}.  

From an American perspective one of the primary antecedents of the current open data movement is the Freedom of Information Act \cite{foia} (FOIA). Further information about the FOIA can be found within Appendix A.
From a sociological perspective, however, one of the underlying determinants of the movement might relate to Anthony Giddens' conception of trust \cite{anthony-giddens-consequences-of-modernity} (as a consequence of modernity).
He suggests that organisational and technological advances mean that many aspects of daily life can not be fully understood (from an individual perspective)
and must, instead, be taken on trust.
A corollary might well be a desire to uncover the truth beneath such trust.
