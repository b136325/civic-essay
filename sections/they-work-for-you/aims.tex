Quoting directly from the website, the aim of makers of the site is that it should "make it much easier for anyone to understand exactly what is going on in Parliament".
I suggest that that aim has been implemented through three aspects of the site: (i) a front-end design that engenders accessibility; (ii) the curation of permanent URLs; and (iii)
the provision of open source and freely available code.
