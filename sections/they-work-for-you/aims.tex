Quoting directly from the They Work for You website, the aim of makers of the site is that it should 'make it much easier for anyone to understand exactly what is going on in Parliament'.
It is suggested that they have attempted to implement that aim most fully with regard to the following three aspects of the site:(i) a front-end design that engenders accessibility; (ii) the curation of permanent URLs; and (iii)
the provision of open source and freely available code.
