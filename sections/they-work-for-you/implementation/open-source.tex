The last aspect of the implementation of the site that enables it to address its aims is through the provision of open source, freely available code.
To that end, the They Work for You site was redevloped into into a tool called Pombola.
The screenshot within Figure \ref{fig:they-work-for-you-implementation-open-source-pombola} depicts information about Pombola showing that it is currently being used to provide information about the parliaments in both Kenya and South Africa.
The Pombola code \cite{mysociety-github} is freely accessible from the GitHub \cite{github} open source, online code repository, as be seen within Figure \ref{fig:they-work-for-you-implementation-open-source-github},
and additional information about the development of Pombola and its hosting on GitHub can be found within Appendix C.
