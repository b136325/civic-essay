The screenshot within Figure \ref{fig:they-work-for-you-implementation-search-box} depicts the home page of the site,
and prominently displayed within the home page is a search box, which, amongst other entry types, accepts postcode \cite{postcodes-uk} values.
When a user enters a postcode within the search box the site will subsequently display information about the MP associated with the entered postcode.
This clear and simple process is a good example of how the design of the site engenders accessibility,
and the postcode based search may be especially useful for those users who do not know the name of their MP.
