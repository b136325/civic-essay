The second aspect of the site that enables it to contribute to civicl society 
is the construction of permanent URLs (or web addresses).

The screen shot within Figure \ref{fig:/they-work-for-you-implementation-permanent-urls-1} shows a summary page (from within the They Work for You) for a debate between two MPs in the House of Commons. 
The debate, itself, is published by They Work for You with a permanent and unique URL.
In addition, each speech (or interjection) within the debate can be viewed (and references) separately; such that, the They Work for You site also allocated permanent and unique URls to each interjection, as can be seen from the screen shot within Figure \ref{fig:they-work-for-you-implementation-permanent-urls-2}.

Such URls curate all interjections and their parent debates, enabling references to them to used acurately across the web.
