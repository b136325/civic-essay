The second aspect of the site that enables it to contribute to civicl society 
is the curation of permanent URLS

In this case, the screen shot depicts ON SLIDE 6 shows a REFERENCE page (within the They Work For you site) OUTLINING a single interjection during a debate in the House of Commons by UK Conservative MP Gary Streeter
The address of the page and hence the description of the interjection is BOTH unique and permanent 
This provides a reference STRUCTURE for all parliamentary speeches that can be used and shared across the web
