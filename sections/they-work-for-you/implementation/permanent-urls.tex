The second aspect of the implementation that enables the site to address its aims is the construction of permanent Uniform Resource Locators (URLs or web addresses).
The screenshot within Figure \ref{fig:/they-work-for-you-implementation-permanent-urls-1} shows a summary page (from within the They Work for You) for an exchange between two MPs in the House of Commons. 
The exchange, itself, is published by They Work for You with a permanent and unique URL. The construction of such URLs therefore provides a means of sharing (across the web) uniquely referenced debates and interjections.
