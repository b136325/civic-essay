The second aspect of the site that enables it to contribute to civil society is the construction of permanent URLs (or web addresses).
The screenshot within Figure \ref{fig:/they-work-for-you-implementation-permanent-urls-1} shows a summary page (from within the They Work for You) for an exchange between two MPs in the House of Commons. 
The exchange, itself, is published by They Work for You with a permanent and unique URL.
In addition, each speech (or interjection) within the exchange can be viewed (and referenced) separately;
such that, the They Work for You site allocates permanent and unique URls to each interjection, as can be seen from the screenshot within Figure \ref{fig:they-work-for-you-implementation-permanent-urls-2}.
The construction of such URLs provides a means of uniquely referencing debates and interjections across the web.
