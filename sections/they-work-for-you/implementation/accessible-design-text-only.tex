A second way in which THE DESIGN OF THE SITE  engenders accessibility
	- can be seen from the screenshot on slide 5
	- console based text only browser
	- displaying the information from The Work For You for the current UK Labour Party leader Jermey Corbyn

	- Text only browser displayed is called Lynx
	- A successor of the first browser developed by Tim Bernes Lee
	
	- Few modern web sites fully support text only browsing
	- However, such browsers are frequently the basis for text to speech browsing as used by those who are blind
	
	- As such, the fact that the site can be viewed via a text only browser is another demonstration of how its design engenders accessibility
	AND HENCE CONTRIBUTES TO CIVIL SOCIETY
