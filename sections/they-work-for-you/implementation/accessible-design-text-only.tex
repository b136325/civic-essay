A second way in which the design of the site engenders accessibility can be seen from the screenshot within Figure \ref{fig:they-work-for-you-implementation-text-only-lynx}.
It depicts a terminal (or console) based text only browser, and it is displaying the information from the They Work for You site for the current UK Labour Party leader Jermey Corbyn \cite{jeremy-corbyn-wiki}.
Further information about text only browsing can be found within Appendix B.

Relatively few modern web sites fully support text only browsing, due to the inclusion of \say{Web 2.0} client side JavaScript \cite{web-2.0-technologies}.
However, text browsers are frequently the basis for text to speech browsing as used by those with disabilities, such as blindness \cite{shelter-guide-web-accessibility}.
As such, the fact that the site can be viewed via a text only browser is another demonstration of how its design engenders accessibility, and, ultimately, contributes to civil society.
