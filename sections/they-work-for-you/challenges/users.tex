A second challenge faced by They Work for You concerns the type of users accessing the site.
Although They Work for You do not publish user statistics, and though further information about the site's potential use of statistics can be found within Appendix 4, the site has an Alexa rank of approximately 125,000 \cite{alexa-rank}.
This suggests, at least aneecdotally, that it receives around 20,000 user visits per month.
Whilst the contributors to the development of the site should be proud of such user enagagement, it is suggested, that there may be an element of self selection amongst those using the site; that is, they are already interested in politics.
Moreover, such self selection may ameliorate the strength of the contribution of the site as a whole to the general public and, thereby, civil society.
