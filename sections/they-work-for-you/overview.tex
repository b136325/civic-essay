They Work for You is a civic technology that was founded by Tom Steinberg in XXXX. It provides information about political representatives, such as MPs and MSP) across all four legislative assemblies in the UK. The site is data driven, in so much as it provides an accessible interface over data drawn, automatically, from secondary sources. Originally, the data shown within the site was ‘scraped’ (using a web robot tool) from the Hansard website. This led to  a discussion in the House of Commons that the site was performing an illegal act. Whilst no prosecution took place, and whilst the site went on to become one of the most well known civic technologies in the UK, it no longer scrapes data from the Hansard site. In fact, since the Open Data initiative (XXXX), the site draws its data directly from a government API.
