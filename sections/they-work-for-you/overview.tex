They Work for You is a civic technology that was founded by Tom Steinberg in 2003.
It provides information about political representatives, such as Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), across all four legislative assemblies in the UK.
The site is data driven.
That is, it provides an accessible interface over data drawn, automatically, from secondary sources.
Originally, the data shown within the site was scraped (using a WGET based script) from the Hansard website.
This led to a discussion in the House of Commons as to whether or not They Work for You were performing an illegal act.
Whilst no prosecution took place, and whilst They Work for You went on to become one of the most well known civic technologies in the UK,
it no longer scrapes data from the Hansard site.
In fact, since the UK Government's Open Data initiative (XXXX), They Work for You draws its data directly from a government Application Programming Interface (or API).
