PIPELINE TAXONOMY of civic tech
	Low Level technologies - such as servers - AND OR accessibility of open web networks - important when considering civic tech in countries with restrictive web practicies
	MovING FORWARD TO THE RIGHT the taxonomy addresses the design of individual civic tech projects
	IT then encompasses the types of engagement such projects offer - group membership
  Lastly, it  finishes with a phrase coined by Tom Steinberg (the founded of My Society) NAMELY - civic power. That is, what types of civic power does a project engender.
  
	I would suggest that this pipeline taxonomy offer strong descriptive power (per individual civic tech project) but, unfortunately, lacks the discriminative clarity of the taxonomy proposed by Micah Sifry.
