The diagram within Figure \ref{fig:taxonomy-pipeline} represnts an alternative \emph{pipeline} taxonomy of civic tech projects.
On the far left hand side of the diagram can be found low level technologies, such as servers or the accessibility of open web networks:
important when considering civic technologies in countries with restrictive web practicies.
Moving horizontally forward to the right, the taxonomy addresses the design of individual civic tech projects, including the types of content that the contain.	
The taxonomy then encompasses the types of engagement such projects offer, with particular regard to group membership.
Lastly, it finishes with a phrase coined by Tom Steinberg \cite{tom-steinberg}, namely, \say{civic power} \cite{tom-steinberg-civic-power}. 
That is, what types of \say{civic power} does a project engender.
